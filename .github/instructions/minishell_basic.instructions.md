We have to code the project minishell, from the 42 school, proposed in the file es.subject.pdf in the root of this repository (accessible on line also)

The code proposed must follow the norm proposed in 42 school. it can be found in the file norminette.pdf in the root f this repository.

the names of the functions have to be descriptive but not too long.

if the changes proposed will affect other parts of the code, explain what and how before executing.

if when evaluating the code, you find mistakes, tellme what is happening.

I prefer not to make a whole lot of changes at a time, but to focus in one determine issue to solve, and going from there, testing it, and then other things that gotta be improved, unless i tell you the oposite.

Is allways important to avoid corruption of memory, and data leaks, and not to violate the norminette once again.
